* Doubts
- [X] javassist in our jar? :: yes
- [X] inheritance
  - [X] default keywords overriding -- yes
  - [X] keywords acessing fields of superclasses ::
    (should be similar to std java constructors)
- [X] keywords that reference each other ::
     we decide on the semantics of that
- [X] annotation with empty string :: no problem, should work
- [X] keywords possible types :: everything


* Extensions proposals
** Methods with keyword arguments
** Constructors and methods with bodies
** Good performance
